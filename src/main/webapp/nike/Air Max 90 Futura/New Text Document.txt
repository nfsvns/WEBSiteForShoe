Specification:
The '90s were a turning point in culture—art, music, fashion and sneakers. 
The Air Max was at the forefront of the movement. 
With even more exposed Air cushioning and a bold new colour affectionately dubbed as "Infrared", 
its revolutionised design helped the first 90 take on a life of its own. No longer just a running shoe, it solidified Air Max as a streetwear cornerstone.
