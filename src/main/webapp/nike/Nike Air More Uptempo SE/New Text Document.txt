Description:
More than perhaps any other silhouette, the Air More Uptempo encapsulates '90s basketball flavour at its finest. 
Big and loud, the unapologetic design represents a hybrid of style and innovation that made major waves when it debuted—and still 
turns heads today. This crafted take keeps it subtle with a crisp white upper, set off by pops of Metallic Silver. 
The iconic AIR graphic comes outlined in metallic detailing for a little extra off-court flair. After all, "a little extra" is what these shoes do best.
