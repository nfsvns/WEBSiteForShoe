Specification:
From backboards to skateboards, the influence of the Nike Dunk is undeniable. 
Although introduced as a basketball shoe in 1985, its flat and grippy soles were perfect for a neglected sports community—skaters. 
Uncovering a subculture craving creativity as much as function, the Dunk released decades of countless colourways that continue to capture the soul of skaters from coast to coast.
